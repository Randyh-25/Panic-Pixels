## üìú What is This Game

**Too Many Pixels** is a high-octane 2D survival shooter developed with Python and Pygame. Players navigate a pixelated desert world, battling endless waves of enemies while collecting experience points and currency. The game features both solo and split-screen cooperative gameplay, with an AI partner that assists in combat. With its roguelike elements, procedural difficulty scaling, and special events like the Devil's appearance, Too Many Pixels offers a challenging and dynamic experience for pixel art enthusiasts and action game fans alike.

## üéÆ Game Mechanics

- **Survival Gameplay**: Survive waves of increasingly difficult enemies in an expansive map
- **Progression System**: Defeat enemies to gain XP and level up, increasing health and abilities
- **Combat**: AI-assisted combat with automatic projectile targeting for nearby threats
- **Economy**: Collect money from defeated enemies to unlock upgrades and abilities
- **Split-Screen Multiplayer**: Play cooperatively with a friend in local split-screen mode
- **Special Events**: The "Devil" appears periodically as a powerful ally that can eliminate enemies within its area of effect
- **Death & Respawn**: When players die, their session stats are recorded before returning to the menu
- **Environmental Effects**: Particle systems create atmospheric desert environments
- **Cheat System**: Hidden command console for debugging and special features

## üß† OOP Implementation

The game showcases the four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming:

### 1. Encapsulation
- **Player Classes** (`player.py`, `player2.py`): Encapsulate player properties and behaviors
- **Enemy Class** (`enemy.py`): Hides internal state and attack behaviors
- **UI Components** (`ui.py`): Encapsulates rendering logic and state

### 2. Inheritance
- **Sprite Inheritance**: All game entities inherit from `pygame.sprite.Sprite`
- **Devil Class** (`devil.py`): Extends base sprite functionality with specialized behaviors
- **Hit Effects** (`hit_effects.py`): RockHitEffect inherits from Sprite for animation system

### 3. Polymorphism
- **Update Methods**: Consistent `update()` interfaces across different entity types:
  - `Enemy.update()`, `Player.update()`, `Projectile.update()`, `ParticleSystem.update()`
- **Draw Methods**: Polymorphic rendering through consistent `draw()` interfaces

### 4. Abstraction
- **Camera System** (`player.py`): Abstracts complex viewport calculations
- **Sound Manager**: Provides high-level sound control without exposing implementation details
- **Particle System** (`particles.py`): Abstracts particle generation and lifecycle management

## üé® Assets Used

  - Menu backgrounds and buttons
  - Split-screen dividers
  
- **Effects**:
  - Particle effects for environment
  - Hit animations (`assets/enemy/collapse/`)
  - Level-up visual effects
  - Death transitions
  
- **Audio**:
  - Gameplay music with map-specific variations
  - Combat sound effects
  - UI feedback sounds
